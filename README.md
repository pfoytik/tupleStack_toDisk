# tupleStack_toDisk
A python script to store a large stack data structure as plain text with append and pop functions 
this project utilizes
 - file_read_backwards in order to efficiently read the last line of text file
 - subprocess to run a linux terminal command with sed in order to remove last line of files

## if using this with different datastructure than a tuple, make sure to edit the second to last cell to convert the string representation to the the datastructure you need.
